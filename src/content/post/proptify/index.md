drawing parallels to this with the potential of large transformer models, feels as of from thin air images, video's and texts can be created. But thinking about the bible verse in John chapter 1 where in the beginning was the word, I strongly think the "word" is some sort of state of matter taking lessons from the Japanese school of thought "Godai" talks about this "void". You see we ave been forced to believe that the void is this tin that takes up space, negative space. A ceap solution is to say if we can observe in the 4th dimension we can see we are measuring space in correctly and its not about the amount of stuff you can fill in a defined volume - its more about uncertainty.
