## Show Do Not Tell

One of your primary roles as a founder is to lead and that means to show do not tell. Some of us will be familiar with the bibe quote from Matthew 23:

> So practice and obey whatever they tell you, but don't follow their example.

In my opinion being a founder is contrary to this advice because in the beginning your prefernetial attachment for your network will be small, so your behaviours are being 
observed assymetrically with greater effect - you must lead by example and help cast the mast that sails your startup forward. Your responsible for the overall vision.
