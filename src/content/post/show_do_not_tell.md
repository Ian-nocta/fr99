## Show Do Not Tell

One of your primary roles as a founder is to lead and that means to show do not tell. Some of us will be familiar with the bibe quote from Matthew 23:

> So practice and obey whatever they tell you, but don't follow their example.

In my opinion being a founder is contrary to this advice because in the beginning your prefernetial attachment for your network will be small, so your behaviours are being 
observed assymetrically with greater effect - you must lead by example and help cast the mast that sails your startup forward. Your responsible for the overall vision.

## Sales Sales Sales

I don't think I am alone in saying this but I would rather not "sell myself", it's a phrase we often hear when embarking on our professional developments and start careers, I would much rather my achievements be read aloud and proclaimed to a crowd as they applaud me but, that's a fantasty an attention demanding economy. Assume no one knows you and operate as such, don't just rely on your merits. I'm not the first and surely won't be the last to say it but sales is not an enjoyable thing but in a startup environment where's its sink or swim you must adopt some tactics of the salesmen. In my opinion sales centers around exploiting the psychology and behaviours in humans for a desired outcome, in a capitalistic one thats money.
