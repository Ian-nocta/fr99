## The Madness of Life

Should we try to make sense of life? Are we ever going to find a reason for out existence or are we just a bunch of organised atoms drifting throughout space?

### Beginning To the End. End of The Beginning 

I don't adhere to time existing in a linear plane, although our units of measurement confined to it. Due to the fact that it implies that time is constantly progressing forward largely driven by the thermodynamic argument of entropy.

Against all rational I believe time would fit better on a circular model, not taking credit nor am I saying this is the best fit. Reasons for choosing a circular model is through natural observation, to my knowledge all animals, insects etc... of Earth's domain undergo a life cycle each of which according to the linear model for measuring time occur for different timespans.



Another idea of measuring time is by measuring the metabolic processes of an organism. I believe inanimate objects like a rock dont observe time

Also not accounting for external factors this would mean biologically we have a pre-determined expiration date
