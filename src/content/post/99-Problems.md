## 99 Probems

> Jay Z famously said I got 99 problems but a b*tch ain't one

To some this might be unsavoury but reassured I interpret the term b*tch,
as a term of endearment for describing a thorny person. 
That being said Mr Carter highlighted the daily numerous daily obstacles 
or problems that he faces but how does he proritise or triage such problems?

One early skill any founder must master early is the art of triaging.
