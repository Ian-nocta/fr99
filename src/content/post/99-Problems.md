## 99 Probems

> Jay Z famously said I got 99 problems but a b*tch ain't one

To some this might be unsavoury but rest assured I interpret the term b*tch,
as a term of endearment for describing a thorny person. 
That being said Mr Carter highlighted the daily abundance of obstacles 
or problems that he faces but how does he proritise or triage such problems?

One early skill any founder must master early is the art of triaging.
Everyday there will so to speak "new fires" that you must attend to with limited
resources. It's all very similar to those games where your actions are all interconnected 
like your health, xp etc...

One way in which to master the art of triaging is to first define the set of probelms 
or more importantly create systems that do e.g. the DABC is ised by emergency services
when they first arrive in the scene to assess for Danger, Airways, Breathing and Circulation these
are all considered the vitals necessary for the life of a patient. I hear you ask what
are the vitals for a startup in this example I will cover the fundamentals:

- Founder
- Human Capital
- User Appeal
- Capital

The "Founder" (ultimately determines the landscape alternayively the so called dangers of the startup)
sets the vision which in turns determines the strategies and products 
that will be created within a timeframe.
