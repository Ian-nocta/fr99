## Investor Founder Fit

From my experience I put investors into two categories, doomers and nurturers. They are pretty much determined by their mindset being pessimistic or optimistic.
Doomers before trying to nurture an idea will spend time picking away at all the small things that could go wrong with an idea killing it before it even takes like fully, 
in my humble opinion doomers sometimes seem to be overlooking the concept that the best companies are not birthed but they arise from the toils and burdens of founders.

During the early stages if there are signs and signals there is no need to be so critical all these things can be ironed out so long as the founder is focusing on the fundamentals 
such as the product and talking to users
