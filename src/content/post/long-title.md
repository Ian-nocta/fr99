## The Allegory of Prudence

> The greatest enemy of any ambitious man is time for its the one quantity that remians unknown from birht but discovered upon death

The Allegory of Prudence a painting by the Titian has a barely visble inscription which says:
> EX PRÆTE/RITO // PRÆSENS PRVDEN/TER AGIT // NI FVTVRA / ACTIONĒ DE/TVRPET

Which in english translates to:

> from the experience of the past, the present acts prudently, lest it spoil future actions

A word to the wise to live by. You see the wise gain projections into the future bu learning from the experience of those before them.
