## Essentialism

> make the thing what it is, and without which it would be not that kind of thing
_George Lakoff_

What this does quote does for me is to help pit in words why it is very hard to actually distill the essence of Essentialism. It's like that feeling you get when, "I just can't put my finger on it moment" this outer-wordly thingy.

### _Intuition > Intellect_ 

I love this speech that Steve Jobs gave at Stanford 2005 (know known as the pathos/ethos/logos speech)

> Donâ€™t let the noise of others opinions drown out your own inner voice and most important have the courage to follow your heart and intuition they somehow know what you truly want to become everything else is secondary 

One of the practices of essentialism I enjoy is the need not to define things but to just move with that gut instinctual thought almost as if to achieve ultra instinct. 

For me essentialism is about developing my gut to the point of which I have developed ultra instinct, allowing me to act exactly as I am intrinsically programmed.

Like the idea of "inertness" that essentialism presents things are intrinsically defined by characteristics or qualities.

One key thing to also acknowledge with Essentialism is that the message can shift through multiple versions of the same person, all in all to deliver the same message.(will develop this thought further a lot to unpack)
