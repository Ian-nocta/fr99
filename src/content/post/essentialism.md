## Essentialism

> make the thing what it is, and without which it would be not that kind of thing
_George Lakoff_

What does this quotes for me makes it very hard to actually distill the essence of what the said "thing" is, that "I just can't put my finger on it moment" almost this outer-wordly thingy.

One of the practices of essentialism I enjoy is the need not to define things but to just move with that gut instinctual thought almost as if to achieve ultra instinct. 

For me essentialism is about developing my gut to the point of which I have developed ultra instinct, allowing me to act exactly as I am intrinsically programmed.

Like the idea of "inertness" that essentialism presents things are intrinsically defined by characteristics or qualities.

One key thing to also acknowledge with Essentialism is that the messenger can shift through multiple versions of the same person, all in all to deliver the same message.
