## Code Divergence

> The soul uses the human body as a vessel, code can find a varity of hosts in the architechture of hardware

It would seem tbe mapping of a soul to a human body is one to one, though I am unsure of the natural laws underpinning this we as humans 
have a developed software which has the ability to take host in a variety of hardware in all forms of shapes and sizes. Interestingly these devices
are used to connect humans.

We acredit tech for having the power to establish connections, this is wrong for we already connected. Technology helps us to uncover these relationships by creating a visual social graph, think of social media working as an API between souls.

With projects like neuralink(unfortunate name due to the large association with Musk) and other brain-computer interfaces start-ups I should really research the competition within this vertical, the metaphysical question around the soul/consciouness all become relevant again.(Gathering my ideas, there is an interesting case with the man and pole in head etc... also my screenshot had an interesting one where someone displayed multiple personality)
