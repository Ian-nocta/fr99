## Code Divergence

> The soul uses the human body as a vessel, code can find a varity of hosts in the architechture of hardware

It would seem tbe mapping of a soul to a human body is one to one, though I am unsure of the natural laws underpinning this we as humans 
have a developed software which has the ability to take host in a variety of hardware in all forms of shapes and sizes. Interestingly these devices
are used to connect humans.

We acceedit tech for having the power to establish connections, this is wrong for we already connected. Technilogy helps us to discover these relationships 
its like an API to the soul or a network
