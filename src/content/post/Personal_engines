## Personal Engines 

> need quote about how data has driven industrial revolutions

If you talk to any fortune 500 company c suite individual and ask about their morning brief it will consists of being presented by a slew of data driven insights conjured up from
compnay reports, customer feedback and etc... Point is enterprise has an abundance of resources and tools to mine, extract and then act on that information. But what about the 
common man or woman, why can't they make these data driven decisions it still feels as if they are operating on some nethandral system it's archaic and this is even more so
for health.

Its 2024 and your own medical history is under lock and key not by you but some third party company, I mean this poses huge questions about "self", identity - if you don't
own or have access to or the ability to communicate with your own information how are we living, vibes or are we living according to someone elses dogma.

Personal engines >>> Search Engines

Time to retire search, we have enough to start on to make the wireframe for personal engines these highly curated feedsa about our lives which provide us with realtime insights
will not only allow us to make a better quality of decisions but also empower the user giving them true autonomy. You see autonomy only works just as well as th user understanding the 
information and limitations. We are still stuck in this ugly duckling phase we're it feels as if we are begging for the data to work for us. We see this with devices such as:
Alexa, Apple home pod,


Personal engine if I were to try to explain how the process looks: Info gathering, info cleaning, info sorting, info mining, info knowledge and info curation (feed) - interesting
when you think about the word "feed" for me I think about the long metal container where livestock eat from all processing and digesting this same mush. 
So far trying to conjure a new word - like stream (has strong images tied to water), loop works too.

I'm aiming for an almost borderline spiritual experience after all magic is just science we can't understand I want to have users feeling this almost esoteric experience and they
revell from all these insights and look at they're body in a new light/dimension
