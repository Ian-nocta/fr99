## Art of War

I have been in both a physical and spiritual war for some time now, I have been making advances but so have my perceived enemies, important point there. Do my enemies even know I refer to them as such or is it all in my head.

Beginning of any battle begins with knowing yourself and your enemy. If your at odds mentally and physically you are twice defeated this even more so true in the attention economy peopl lack the time to make deep internal reflections. They don't even realise they are enemy to themselves.

Some of my battles this list is not exhaustive:

- Social media stop being a slave to the algorithm
- Apple lack of support for their products
- Dell my laptop keys randomly stop working
- Microsoft support tired of the performative support and the nuanced ticket system its slow and redundant
- Family members who only seek opportunity in their pursuit and no marriage of compromise
- Battle with relationships in respects to trust, I can't trust no one.

thinking about that Bruce Lee quote where his sensei asks about his technique and then his opponent, Bruce Lee responds that “there is no opponent.” When his teacher asks him why that is, Lee responds, “because the word “I” does not exist.”






Reading about this made me have some questions why can't we both a warrior and gardener why is that this outcome seems mutually exclusive.

Warrior and gardener have to different outcomes(is thus even true) gardener sows to reap (I think its because we always focus on the bringing life side of the gardener when also there is the cycle of death involved too) I think a warrior is more a strategician and not limiting themselves to range of (inset word) I want to be a strategist put me on Any board and let me figure out the best method of action how to go about this.
“The Peaceful Warrior”, in which a young apprentice, while training in the use of the Chinese sword, asked his teacher why, if he was striving to be inwardly calm and at peace, he needed to learn the ways of a warrior. “Would it not be more tranquil and serene to be a gardener and tend the plants?” he asked. “Tending the garden,” the master replied, “is a relaxing pastime, but it does not prepare one for the inevitable battles of life. It is easy to be calm in a serene setting. To be calm and serene when under attack is much more difficult; therefore, I tell you that it is far better to be a warrior tending his garden rather than a gardener at war.”



Another quote I like

> Outside noisy, inside empty refers to the pretender. Outside quiet, inside secure refers to the warrior
