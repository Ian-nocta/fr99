## Art of War

I have been in both a physical and spiritual war for some time now, I have been making advances but so have my perceived enemies, important point there. Do my enemies even know I refer to them as such or is it all in my head.

Beginning of any battle begins with knowing yourself and your enemy. If your at odds mentally and physically you are twice defeated this even more so true in the attention economy peopl lack the time to make deep internal reflections. They don't even realise they are enemy to themselves.
