The outcome justifies the deeds. 

> In order for the good men to protect the world sometimes they must do a little bad

On one hand, it can be argued that sometimes, in order for good people to protect the world, they must engage in actions that are morally questionable. This is an extension of the double doctrine effect, where achieving a greater good may require a tradeoff that involves doing something that we would typically consider evil.

This is also a much bigger issue surrounding our binary stance on morality. By that definition, natural selection would be inherently evil, despite the millions of years of technological advances we have as a result of it. I would not be here typing this.
